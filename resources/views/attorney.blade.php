								<p>Atty. Benedicto's stand is that providing aid or assistance to a client is much more important than winning a case. The first thing that comes 
								to his mind when handling a client is the study of the merits of the case. The end goal of Atty. Benedicto is not winning but more of assisting the 
								client and thats what made the Benedicto Law Office today.</p>
